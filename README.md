# Lab 1

The PixLab is the second lab of the year in AP Computer Science A.

You will be applying your knowledge of two dimensional arrays (along with previous concepts) to manipulate images, which are just 2D grids of colors (pixels).

We will also be covering binary, which is sometimes on the AP Exam. 

At the end of the lab we will have an exam covering 2D arrays, binary, and enhanced for loops.

## Important Info

If using an IDE on your computer such as BlueJ, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc., download the Github repo as a zip. The classes and images folders should be at the same level in the project folder OR the images can be copied into the same folder as the .java files. Don't forget to include the .gif files in the classes file.

If using Repl.it, download the Github repo as a zip. Then go to Repl.it and choose "Upload file" and upload all of the .java files and the two .gif files in the classes folder. Then upload all of the images in the images folder. Do not delete `Main.java`. In order to run the program, click "Run" which will compile all of the files run `Main.java`, which will print `Hello World!`, but just ignore it. Then in the console type `java <classname>` and then hit enter. For example, if you want to run `ColorChooser.java`, type `java ColorChooser` (don't include the .java). If you close the program and the orange arrow doesn't show up again, click inside the console and press `CTRL-C`.
